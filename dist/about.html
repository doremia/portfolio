                        - My favorite therapy is puppy therapy. <br>
                        - I love my dad. He says good morning to me everyday. <br>
                        - I love a room full of sunshine. <br>
                        - I make healthy decisions when grocery shopping and miss the chocolate I see from earlier terribly. <br>
                        - I would "accidentally" open a shopping website, add items to the shopping cart then close it. <br>
