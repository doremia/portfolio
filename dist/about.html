I believe that if you learn to speak in someone else's language, you can better understand their logic.

                        - My favorite therapy is puppy therapy. <br>
                        - I love my dad. He says good morning to me everyday. <br>
                        - I love a room full of sunshine. <br>
                        - I make healthy decisions when grocery shopping and then later terribly miss the chocolate I didn't buy. <br>
                        - I sometimes "accidentally" open a shopping website, add items to the shopping cart then close it. <br>
